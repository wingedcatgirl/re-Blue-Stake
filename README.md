### re:Blue Stake - a hypothetical rework of Blue Stake

Changes the effect of Blue Stake from "-1 Discard" to "Showdown Blinds appear twice as often". (That's 4, if you don't have any mods that change it.)

This is for funsies more than anything. There are reasons I don't think this is going to be LocalThunk's revamp idea.
