### re:Blue Stake - a hypothetical rework of Blue Stake

Changes the effect of Blue Stake from "-1 Discard" to "Showdown Blinds appear twice as often". (That's 4, if you don't have any mods that change it.)

You can also use the config to select exactly which Showdown Blind will appear in Ante 4, if you so desire.

This is for funsies more than anything. There are reasons I don't think this is going to be LocalThunk's revamp idea.
